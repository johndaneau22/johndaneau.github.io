    <p>Each year millions of people play fantasy football. 
        They spend hours looking over data and trying to find any advantage they can over their friends and co-workers. Glory and bragging rights are at stake!</p>
    <p>Trying to forecast which players will boom and bust for the upcoming season can have you feeling like the Zack Galinfakis meme.</p>

    <p>One of the key data points I've used in the past has been an efficiency ratio of Fantasy Points per Touch. As any experienced fantasy player would tell you,
        touches are key to racking up points. The more opportunity a player gets by getting a rush or getting thrown the ball then the more likely they are to racking
        up points and helping your fantasy team win. We will see on the following charts that this general trend is true: more touches has a strong correlation to more points.
    </p>
    <p>But within that data we can find potentially overlooked players. Most fantasy managers focus on how many points a player had the previous season. But if we
        want to win in the upcoming season, we need to find players who are going to have breakout seasons. By looking at Fantasy Points per Touch, we can potentially
        discover overlooked players who perform well with their touches, and if are in better standing with their teams in the upcoming season they may have breakout seasons. 
        Conversely, we can find players who got lots of touches and didn't make as much of them as their peers. These inefficent players may be due for regression for the upcoming season
        as the coaches may start to limit their opportunities. We may want to avoid these inefficent players.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following charts step through the three primary positions where touches matter: Running Back, Wide Receiver, and Tight End. The charts show a scatterplot of their touches and fantasy points scored.
        The size of their circles are a visual representation of their Fantasy Points per Touch ratio. The bigger the circle the more efficient. On each chart I've highlighted the Most and Least Efficent Players.
        You can also hover over the different circles to find out which players lie where and additional details.
